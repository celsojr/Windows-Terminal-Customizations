# TL;DR

I've followed these [oh-my-posh](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh) instructions and made some minor changes to the files as you can see here on this repo. Look at the difference between the commits to know where I've made the changes.

I'm still doing some customizations but I think it's a good starting point.

PS. Don't forget to install the correct ttf font if you haven't done yet.
